Changes for python-ly
=====================

2014-02-05: python-ly 0.3
- new command 'highlight' ('hl') to create syntax-highlighted HTML files of
  LilyPond source files (or any file that is understood by ly.lex)
- new, very experimental, command 'musicxml' to export music to MusicXML  


2014-01-08: python-ly 0.2
- new commands 'abs2rel' and 'rel2abs' that convert \relative music to
  absolute and vice versa
- support for Python 3. Not all of the ly python module has already been
  tested, but installing and running the various ly commands works well.


2014-01-07: python-ly 0.1
- initial release
